Cloud Computing Assignment - MealPlanner

Project completed in final year in semester one. The website application is a monolithic application, which allowed users to create an account, reset password and login/logout. 
MealPlanner allowed users to search for recipes using our own database using sourced recipes from other websites, enabled users to enter their location/suburb, which showed the nearest supermarkets near them using Google's Maps API, and enabled them to create meal plans.

## API's used:
- App Engine
- Datastore API
- BigQuery API
- Cloud Storage API
- Maps Embed API
